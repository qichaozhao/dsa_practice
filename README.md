# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

Implementing data structures and algorithms from Wiley's "Data Structures & Algorithms in Python" book.

Implementations and tests in both C and Python.

ch05 - Vectors (dynamically resizing array).
ch06 - Queues (backed by fixed size array, dynamically resizing array with circular indexing, and linked list)
ch07 - Single Linked List (with head + tail pointers, and a head sentinel node in the C implementation)
